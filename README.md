# Player_Position_Prediction 
## Problem Statement

The object of our project is:
1. Design a system that can determine what positions a soccer player can play at, so that if a substitute is needed for a certain position, the players who can play there are known. 

2. Explore multi-label classifiers in Sklearn package.

3. See how ensemble models can be used for multi-label classification problems

### Dataset
We use FIFA soccer video game dataset to simulate the problem for actual players.

Total Records: 90k

We one hot encoded it to feed it to our models.

### Models
Since, one player can play from more than one position, we identified our problem statement as a Muli-label classification problem. We considered following algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression 
2. Random Forest

We explored Sklearn's multi-label classifiers as well as built our own one-vs-all ensemble models for this purpose. Architectures for both the approaches are shown below:
